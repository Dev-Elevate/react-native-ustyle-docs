# Tradeoffs

As of now, `react-native-ustyle` is a strict **build-time** only solution and intends to stay the same. This brings all the 
tradeoffs that we find with build-time over run-time.

So let's list down what won't work:

### Dynamic styling:

You can't change the style at runtime. For example you can't have a dark mode and a light mode and switch between them at runtime.

```jsx
// This won't work

import { View } from "react-native-ustyle";

const MyComponent = ({ darkMode }) => (
  <View bg={darkMode ? 'black' : 'white' } />
)
```

### Variable styles:

You can't have styles that depend on some variable. For example you can't have a style that depends on the screen width.

```jsx
// This won't work

import { View } from "react-native-ustyle";

const variable_width = 300;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View w={variable_width} />
)
```
