# Virtual Components

`react-native-ustyle` allows you to create styled components without actually creating a new React component. This is called 
a **virtual component**.

## What is a virtual component?

A virtual component is a component that doesn't actually exist. You just define few theme properties in the rnu.config.ts file and 
then you get a component that you can use in your code like any other component. But it doesn't actually exist in the code.

## How to create a virtual component?

To create a virtual component, you need to define a new components property in the rnu.config.ts file. For example, let's say you want to
create a virtual component called `MyView` that has a background color and a width and is made using View from react-native. You can define it like this:

```typescript
// rnu.config.ts

// rnu.config.ts
import { createConfig } from 'react-native-ustyle';
export const CONFIG = createConfig({
  // ... rest of the config
  components: {
    MyView: {
      tag: 'View',
      baseStyle: {
        backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
        width: 300,
      },
    },
  },
} as const);

type ConfigType = typeof CONFIG;

declare module 'react-native-ustyle' {
  interface ICustomConfig extends ConfigType {}
}

```

Now you can use `MyView` in your code like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { VC,Text } from 'react-native-ustyle';
const { MyView } = VC;

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MyView>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </MyView>
  );
};
```

## How does it work?

When you use `MyView` in your code, `react-native-ustyle` will replace the `MyView` component in JSX with the `tag` that you defined along with the styles defined in the `rnu.config.ts` file. 
This way you can use `MyView` like any other component, but it doesn't actually exist in the code.

So in the above example, `MyView` will be replaced with `View` and the styles will be applied to it. So it will look like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={[rnuStyles0]}>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const rnuStyles0 = {
  backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  width: 300,
};
```
