Welcome to `react-native-ustyle`, a seamless drop-in replacement for React Native that supercharges your development experience.
This library introduces configurable utility props for styling, hence the name (React Native **UTILITY+STYLE**), it enhances all React Native components without adding any 
runtime overhead. Moreover, it is fully typed, providing the benefits of type checking and autocompletion.


## Simplified Development with react-native-ustyle

`react-native-ustyle` is designed to make React Native development easier and more efficient. By adding configurable utility props
for styling, we eliminate the need for writing repetitive and complex stylesheets. Now, you can directly style your components 
using props, making your code cleaner and more readable.

One of my favorite example showing the power of utility props is this mentioned here in NativeBase Docs - https://docs.nativebase.io/utility-first
It takes you on a journey of how you can use utility props to style your components and compare it with the traditional way of styling.

## Token Based Theming

`react-native-ustyle` also introduces token-based theming, which allows you to define a set of tokens that can be used to style your
components. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across your app, as you can easily update the tokens to
change the appearance of your components.

## Fully Typed for Type Safety

`react-native-ustyle` is fully typed, which means you get the benefits of TypeScript's static type checking. This not only helps 
catch errors early in the development process but also provides autocompletion, making it easier to write and navigate your code.
Also it provides you with the ability to use the utility props with the correct types.

## Zero Runtime Overhead

One of the key features of `react-native-ustyle` is its zero runtime overhead. Despite the added functionality, it doesn't affect 
the performance of your React Native applications. This is because the utility props are resolved at compile-time, ensuring that 
your app remains as fast and responsive as ever.

## Seamless Integration

Integrating `react-native-ustyle` into your existing React Native projects is a breeze. As a drop-in replacement, it requires 
minimal changes to your codebase. Simply replace your React Native imports with react-native-ustyle, and you're good to go.

In conclusion, **react-native-ustyle** offers a more efficient, cleaner, and performant way to develop React Native applications. 
Give it a try and supercharge your React Native development experience.
